\question Cindy lives near the Colorado River and frequently canoes in a section of the river where the current is not
too strong.  One Saturday, she went canoeing.  She learned from a friend that the current in the river was 2 mph.  If it
took Cindy the same amount of time to travel 10 miles downstream as 2 miles upstream, determine the speed at which
Cindy's canoe would travel in still water.
