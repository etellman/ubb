  % \section{Strategies}

  % Getting good at taking tests takes practice, just like anything else.  Taking a
  % test is a little different from doing homework or solving real world problems
  % mostly because of the time constraint.  Here are some things you might want to
  % keep in mind.

  % Your goal is not necessarily to solve every problem.  The goal is to maximize
  % the number of points you get.  So you should spend your limited amount of time
  % in the way which is mostly likely to produce the most points.

  % For example, suppose you have 15 minutes left when you get to problem 20.  You
  % take a glance at it and have no idea how to solve it.  If you spend the entire
  % fifteen minutes working on problem 20, the best possible result is five more
  % points.  And there is a decent chance that you will end up with less than 5
  % points, since the problem looks tough.

  % Instead, you might remember that you didn't check your work yet on problems
  % 1--19.  Since you were working quickly and trying to get everything done, you
  % probably made a few mistakes.  Going back and plugging your answers back into
  % the original equations will probably take a minute or two per problem.  If you
  % find 3 or 4 addition mistakes, signs swapped, etc., you'll get 6 or 7 more
  % points.  So in this case, checking your work on the earlier problems is
  % probably a better use of your time.

  % The strategy I use is to try to check a result immediately after I do it,
  % especially if the result is an integer and the original equation isn't too
  % complicated.  In this case, you can often check the result in 30 seconds or
  % less, and find a mistake right away while you are still thinking about that
  % problem.  If I'm pressed for time and checking the result looks like it will
  % take a bit longer, I'll move on and come back to check that result if I have
  % time.

  % Basically, you want to make sure that you get full credit for all of the
  % problems you actually know how to solve, and don't lose points because of
  % simple adding mistakes, etc.

  % Another thing to keep in mind is that I mentioned that calculators are not
  % required and wouldn't be particularly useful.  If you find yourself doing some
  % complicated long division calculation, don't think to yourself: ``Ed's
  % idea of when a calculator is useful is different from my idea of when a
  % calculator would be useful.''  Instead, think to yourself: ``I bet I messed
  % something up in the steps leading up to this calculation.''

  % When you are working on a problem which starts out with a bunch of elaborate
  % fractions and you get an integer solution, you can usually feel a little more
  % hopeful that your answer is correct.  It doesn't necessarily mean that your
  % answer is correct, of course, and the actual answer may be a fraction.  But
  % often problems are constructed to have simple answers, and it is a bit unlikely
  % that you'll get a simple answer from a complicated start just by chance.

  % For instance, if I do a bunch of calculations and end up with something like
  % 101/50 my immediate reaction is usually: ``I bet this problem was supposed to
  % come out to 2'' since 101/50 is almost exactly 2.  I'll view 101/50 with
  % suspicion and go back and double check all my calculations, looking for a place
  % where I might have added in an extra 1.  Of course, 101/50 might be the correct
  % answer, but it is just a warning sign that time spent double-checking that
  % particular result could be well spent and may result in a few more points.

  \section{Suggestions}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Check your answer by plugging your result back into the original
      equation (or original problem statement, for word problems).  We all make
      simple arithmetic mistakes, but you can usually catch them and fix them if
      you plug your answer back in to the original equation.

    \item Don't try to do too many steps at once in your head.  It's easy to make
      a mistake if you are juggling several numbers in your head at once.

    \item Show your work so I can give you partial credit if you went amiss
      somewhere along the line.

        \end{align*}
      \end{solution}

    \subsection{Formulas}

    For problems~\ref{formula:first}--\ref{formula:last}, solve each equation for $x$.

    \question[10]\label{formula:first}
      \[ 
        \frac{x}{3} + a = \frac{b}{2} 
      \]

      \begin{solution}
        \begin{align*}
          \frac{x}{3} + a                  & = \frac{b}{2} \\
          3 \left( \frac{x}{3} + a \right) & = 3 \left( \frac{b}{2} \right) \\
          x + 3a                           & = \frac{3b}{2} \\
          x                                & = \frac{3b}{2} - 3a\\
        \end{align*}

        Some other ways to write the answer are: 
        \begin{align*}
          x & = 3 \del{ \frac{b}{2} - a } \\
          x & = \frac{3b - 6a}{2} \\
        \end{align*}
      \end{solution}

    \question[10]\label{formula:last}
      \[ 
        a(x + b) = b(x - c) 
      \]
      \begin{solution}
        \begin{align*}
          a(x + b)     & = b(x - c) \\
          ax + ab      & = bx - bc  \\
          ax + ab - bx & = -bc  \\
          ax - bx      & = -ab - bc  \\
          x(a - b)     & = -ab - bc  \\
          x            & = \frac{-ab - bc}{a - b}  \\
        \end{align*}

        Another way to write the solution is: 
        \[ 
          x = \frac{-ab - bc}{a - b} \del{ \frac{-1}{-1} } = \frac{ab + bc}{b - a} 
        \]

      \end{solution}

    \question{}
    According to doctors, each night a young person should sleep 8 hours plus
    $\sfrac{1}{4}$ hour for each year that the person is under 18 years old.  For
    example, a 14 year old should sleep 9 hours a night.

    \begin{parts}
      \part[8] If age is $a$ and hours of sleep needed is $h$, write a formula
              expressing $h$ in terms of $a$.
        \begin{solution}
          \[ 
            h = 8 + \frac{1}{4}(18 - a)
          \]
        \end{solution}

      \part[2] According to your formula, how many hours of sleep would a 4-year
              old need each night?

        \begin{solution}
          Plugging in $a = 4$:
          \[ 
            h = 8 + \frac{1}{4}(18 - 4) = 8 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot 14 = \frac{23}{2}
          \]

          A 4-year old should sleep $11 \sfrac{1}{2}$ hours each night.
        \end{solution}

    \end{parts}

          4(x - 2) - 3(x + 1)                          & \leq 18 \\

    \question[10]\label{inequality:last}

    The UBB fund raiser is coming up in about a week.  Suppose the auction
    includes an equal number of UBB mugs, artwork, and teddy bears and we would
    like the average price for these items to be at least \$50.  If UBB mugs
    sell for \$15 and paintings sell for \$110, what would teddy bears have to
    sell for to reach the goal of \$50 per item on average?  Express your
    answer in interval form.

    \begin{solution}
      Let $x$ be the price of teddy bears.

      \begin{align*}
        \frac{15 + 110 + x}{3} & \geq 50 \\
        \frac{125 + x}{3}      & \geq 50 \\
        125 + x                & \geq 150 \\
        x                      & \geq 25 \\
      \end{align*}

      In interval form: $\intco{ 25, \infty }$

    \subsection{Word Problems}

    For problems~\ref{word:first}--\ref{word:last}, solve each problem by
    setting up and solving an appropriate algebraic equation.

    \question[10]\label{word:first}

      Find three consecutive numbers such that three times the first plus two
      times the second is two more than four times the third.

      \begin{solution}
        Let $x$ be the first number, $x + 1$ be the second number, and $x + 2$ be the third number.
        \begin{align*}
          3x + 2(x + 1) & = 2 + 4(x + 2) \\
          3x + 2x + 2   & = 2 + 4x + 8 \\
          5x + 2        & = 4x + 10 \\
          x + 2         & = 10 \\
          x             & = 8 \\
        \end{align*}

        The three numbers are 8, 9, and 10.  

        To check, three times 8 is 24 and two times 9 is 18.  $24 + 18 = 42$ which is two more than four times 10.
      \end{solution}

    \question[15]\label{word:last}
      It's that magical time again when the Winter Olympics roll around and we
      all stare in bewilderment at our TVs and try to figure out what the
      difference is between a bobsled and a luge and wonder why they don't liven
      up the curling a bit by allowing the contestants to whack each other with
      the sticks.

      Curiously, when the medal totals are printed in the paper, a bronze counts
      for just as much as a gold.  If I was running the Olympics, I'd do things a
      little differently.  I'd count a gold medal as 4 points, a silver medal as
      2 points, and a bronze medal as 1 point.  For this question, we'll imagine
      that the Olympic committee decided to adopt my scoring system.

      Suppose the US and Canada are in heated competition over 10 skiing events.
      In fact, the two countries are so dominant that they take all the medals
      for these 10 events.  The countries are so evenly matched that they manage
      to each get exactly the same number of total medals and the same number of
      bronze medals for these events.

      Under the standard scoring system, they'd be tied, of course.  But under my
      scoring system, the US comes out 8 points ahead.  How many gold and silver
      medals does each country take from the 10 events?

      \begin{solution}
        This problem is similar to the Super Bowl problem, with gold and silver
        medals instead of touchdowns and field goals.

        The first thing to notice is that the number of gold medals the US wins
        is the same as the number of silver medals Canada wins, since each event
        has one of each type of medal and the countries ended up with the same
        number of medals.  Similarly, the number of gold medals that Canada wins
        is the same as the number of silver medals that the US wins.

        There are 10 events, so there are 10 gold medals, 10 silver medals, and
        10 bronze medals.  It says in the problem statement that each country got
        5 bronze medals.  You can ignore the bronze medals, since each country
        got the same number. 

        If we let $x$ be the number of gold medals the US wins and the number of
        silver medals Canada wins, the equation is:

        \begin{align*}
          4x + 2(10 - x) & = 4(10 - x) + 2x + 8\\
          4x + 20 - 2x   & = 40 - 4x + 2x + 8\\
          2x + 20        & = 48 - 2x \\
          4x + 20        & = 48 \\
          4x             & = 28 \\
          x              & = 7 \\
        \end{align*}

        The US won 7 gold medals, 3 silver medals, and 5 bronze medals for $28
        + 6 + 5 = 39$ points.  Canada won 3 gold medals, 7 silver medals, and 5
        bronze medals for $12 + 14 + 5 = 31$ points.  The US wins by 8 points,
        so the solution is correct.

        If you can't come up with an equation right away, you might want to try
        some examples.  Experimenting with an example is likely to lead you down
        the path towards the correct solution.

        For example, you might say:  ``Suppose the US wins 6 events and Canada
        wins 4 events.''  You could then figure out the score for that situation
        would be: $us = 6 \cdot 4 + 4 \cdot 2 + 5 = 37$ and 
        $ca = 4 \cdot 4 + 6 \cdot 2 + 5 = 33$

        Looking at these numbers, the difference is only 4, so the 6 and 4 is not
        the correct answer.  But the equations for the two countries look
        similar, so you might then realize that when the US wins $x$ golds,
        Canada wins $10 - x$ golds, which might lead you to the correct equation.
         
      \end{solution}

    \question[10]
      Two skaters, Jennie and Maude stood a mile apart on a frozen lake.  Then
      each skated directly to the spot where the other had been standing.  With
      the help of a strong wind, Jennie performed the feat two and one-half
      times faster than Maude and beat her by six minutes.  How long did it
      take each girl to skate the mile?

      \begin{solution}
        We can use $d = rt$ for this problem.  If we let Maude's rate be $r$ and
        Jennie's time be $t$, we know that Maude skated the mile in $\frac{5}{2}
        rt$ and Jennie skated the mile in $r(t + 6)$.  Since they each skated a
        mile, these two equations must be equal:

        \begin{align*}
          \frac{5}{2} \cdot rt & = r(t + 6) \\
          \frac{5t}{2}         & = t + 6 \\
          5t                   & = 2t + 12 \\
          3t                   & = 12 \\
          t                    & = 4 \\
        \end{align*}

        Jennie skated the mile in 4 minutes and Maude skated the mile in 10
        minutes.  10 minutes is two and one-half times as long as 4 minutes, so
        Jennie was two and one-half times faster and the solution is correct.
