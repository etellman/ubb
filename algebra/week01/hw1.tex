  % Read Chapter 1.  Most of it should be review, but take a glance at it anyway to make sure you are familiar with
  % everything.  

  \section{Problems}

  % The answers to the odd numbered problems are in the back of the book.

  % If you have trouble with anything, ask a TA or another student for some assistance.  We'll go over
  % some of the problems and answer any questions in class next week.

    \question

    In 1772, the German astronomer Johann Elert Bode found a pattern in the distances of the planets
    from the sun.  At the time, only six planets were known.  The actual relative distances of the
    planets from the sun and his pattern are:

    \vspace{0.5 cm}
      \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        Planet  & Actual Distance & Bode's Pattern \\ 
        \hline
        Mercury & 4               & \( 0 + 4 = 4 \) \\
        Venus   & 7               & \( 3 + 4 = 7 \) \\
        Earth   & 10              & \( 6 + 4 = 10 \) \\
        Mars    & 15              & \( 12 + 4 = 16 \) \\
                &                 &  \\
        Jupiter & 52              & \( 48 + 4 = 52 \) \\
        Saturn  & 96              & \( 96 + 4 = 100 \) \\
                &                 &  \\
        \hline
      \end{tabular}
    \vspace{0.5 cm}

    \begin{parts}
      \part What equation belongs between Bode's equations for Mars and Jupiter?

      \begin{solution}
        The equations all look like: \( n + 4 = \ldots \).  The only thing that changes from
        equation to equation is the value of $n$.  After the first equation, each value of $n$ is
        twice its value from the preceding equation.  

        A slightly more formal way of saying the same thing is that after the first equation, the
        equations are  look like: \( 2^n \cdot 3 + 4 \), where n = \{ 0, 1, 2, \ldots \}.  

        Either way, the missing equation is: \( 24 + 4 = 28 \)

      \end{solution}
      \part What equation belongs after Bode's equation for Saturn?

      \begin{solution}
        Using the same reasoning, the missing equation is: \( 192 + 4 = 196 \)

      \end{solution}

    \end{parts}

    In 1781 William Herschel discovered Uranus, the next planet beyond Saturn.  Because its distance
    of 192 units comes remarkably close to the number predicted by the equation, astronomers came to
    the conclusion that the equation between Bode's equations for Mars and Jupiter must also mean
    something.  In fact, in 1801, the asteroid Ceres was discovered at a distance of 28 units from
    the sun.

    \question

    In the late sixteenth century, the Italian scientist Galileo discovered a relationship between
    the length of a pendulum and the time of the swing:

    \vspace{0.5 cm}
      \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
        \hline
        Length of Pendulum  & Time of Swing \\ 
        \hline
        1 unit  & 1 second \\
        4 units & 2 seconds \\
        9 units & 3 seconds \\
        16 units & 4 seconds \\
        \hline
      \end{tabular}
    \vspace{0.5 cm}

    \begin{parts}
    \part
    Write an equation for the length of the pendulum in terms of the time of the swing.

    \begin{solution}
    The length is always the time of the swing squared.  So the equation is: \( L = T^2 \)
    \end{solution}

    \part
    What would be length of a pendulum with a swing of 8 seconds?

    \begin{solution}
    Substituting 8 into the equation gives: 
    \begin{eqnarray*}
      L & = & T^2 \\
        & = & 8^2 \\
        & = & 64 \\
    \end{eqnarray*}
    \end{solution}

    \end{parts}

    \question

    You have 9 metal balls and a balance which allows you to compare the weight of two balls or two
    groups of balls.  You know that one of the balls is slightly heaver than the others but don't
    know which one is the heavier ball.  What is the smallest number of weighings required to
    identify the heavier ball?

    \begin{solution}
      To minimize the number of weighings, you want to eliminate as many balls as possible with each
      weighing.  This approach allows you to eliminate \(2/3\) of the balls each time, resulting in
      two weighings:

      \begin{itemize}
        \item 
          Divide the balls into three groups of three.  Select two of the groups and put them on the
          balance.  If one of the groups is heavier, the heavy ball is in that group.  Otherwise,
          the heavy ball is in the group you didn't weigh.

        \item 
          Select two balls from the group containing the heavy ball and put them on the balance.  If
          one of them is heavier, it, obviously, is the heavy ball.  Otherwise, the third ball is
          the heavy ball. 

      \end{itemize}

      This procedure works for any number of balls that is a power of three.  The number of
      weighings required is equal to the exponent:

    \begin{center}
      \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        Exponent & Number of Balls & Number of Weighings \\
        \hline
        0 & $3^0 = 1$ & 0 \\
        1 & $3^1 = 3$ & 1 \\
        2 & $3^2 = 9$ & 2 \\
        3 & $3^3 = 27$ & 3 \\
        4 & $3^4 = 81$ & 4 \\
        \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
        \hline

      \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    \end{solution}

    \question

    You throw away your balance and buy a scale instead.  But you are now faced with a different problem.  

    You have 10 stacks of coins, each of which contains 10 coins.  You know that one stack is full
    of counterfeit coins while all the other stacks contain real coins.  You also know that a real
    coin weighs 10 ounces while a counterfeit coin weighs 11 ounces.  What is the smallest number of
    weighings required to identify the stack of counterfeit coins?

    \begin{solution}

    The best approach only requires one weighing.  The key is to notice that you can select
    different numbers of coins from each stack.  So what you do is select 1 coin from the first
    stack, 2 coins from the second stack, 3 coins from the third stack, etc. and weigh them all at
    once.

    If all of the coins were real coins, you would expect the total to be: 
    \[ 10 \cdot (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10)  = 10 \cdot 55 = 550 \]

    The actual total will be more than the expected total by the stack number.  

    For example, suppose stack 7 contains the counterfeit coins.  The seven coins you included from
    stack 7 all weigh one ounce more than they should, so the total in this case will be: 
    $550 + 7 = 662$.

    To get the number of the stack containing the counterfeit coins, you just need to subtract 550
    from whatever it says on the scale.

    \end{solution}
