  %   \question

  %     In 1772, the German astronomer Johann Elert Bode found a pattern in the
  %     distances of the planets from the sun.  At the time, only six planets
  %     were known.  The actual relative distances of the planets from the sun
  %     and his pattern are:

  %     \begin{tabular}{lrr}
  %       \toprule
  %       Planet  & Actual Distance & Bode's Pattern \\ 
  %       \midrule
  %       Mercury & 4               & \( 0 + 4 = 4 \) \\
  %       Venus   & 7               & \( 3 + 4 = 7 \) \\
  %       Earth   & 10              & \( 6 + 4 = 10 \) \\
  %       Mars    & 15              & \( 12 + 4 = 16 \) \\
  %       ?       & ?               & ? \\
  %       Jupiter & 52              & \( 48 + 4 = 52 \) \\
  %       Saturn  & 96              & \( 96 + 4 = 100 \) \\
  %       \bottomrule
  %     \end{tabular}

  %     \begin{parts}
  %       \part What equation belongs between Bode's equations for Mars and Jupiter?

  %       \begin{solution}
  %         After the first equation, the equations all look like: 
  %         \[ 
  %           2^n \cdot 3 + 4 
  %         \]
  %         where n = \{ 0, 1, 2, \ldots \}.  

  %         The missing equation is: $24 + 4 = 28$

  %       \end{solution}
  %       \part What equation belongs after Bode's equation for Saturn?

  %       \begin{solution}
  %         Using the same reasoning, the missing equation is: $192 + 4 = 196$

  %         In 1781 William Herschel discovered Uranus, the next planet beyond Saturn.  Because its
  %         distance of 192 units comes remarkably close to the number predicted by the equation,
  %         astronomers came to the conclusion that the equation between Bode's equations for Mars and
  %         Jupiter must also mean something.  In fact, in 1801, the asteroid Ceres was discovered at
  %         a distance of 28 units from the sun.

  %       \end{solution}

  %     \end{parts}

  %   \question

  %     In the late sixteenth century, the Italian scientist Galileo discovered an interesting
  %     relationship between the length of a pendulum and the time of the swing:

  %     \begin{tabular}{cc}
  %       \toprule
  %       Length of Pendulum & Time of Swing \\
  %       \midrule
  %       1 unit             & 1 second \\
  %       4 units            & 2 seconds \\
  %       9 units            & 3 seconds \\
  %       16 units           & 4 seconds \\
  %       \bottomrule
  %     \end{tabular}

  %     \begin{parts}
  %     \part
  %       Write an equation for the length of the pendulum in terms of the time of the swing.

  %       \begin{solution}
  %         The length is always the time of the swing squared.  So the equation is: 
  %         \[
  %           \boxed{ L = T^2 } 
  %         \]
  %       \end{solution}

  %     \part
  %       What would be length of a pendulum with a swing of 8 seconds?

  %       \begin{solution}
  %         Substituting 8 into the equation gives: 
  %         \begin{align*}
  %           L & = T^2 \\
  %             & = 8^2 \\
  %             & = \boxed{ 64 } \\
  %         \end{align*}
  %       \end{solution}

    \section{Extra Credit}

    \begin{questions}

      \question
        You have 9 metal balls and a balance which allows you to compare the weight of two balls or
        two groups of balls.  You know that one of the balls is slightly heaver than the others but
        don't know which one is the heavier ball.  What is the smallest number of weighings required
        to identify the heavier ball?

        \begin{solution}
          To minimize the number of weighings, you want to eliminate as many balls as possible with each
          weighing.  This approach allows you to eliminate two thirds of the balls each time, resulting
          in two weighings.

          \begin{itemize}
            \item 
              Divide the balls into three groups of three.  Select two of the groups and put them on
              the balance.  If one of the groups is heavier, the heavy ball is in that group.
              Otherwise, the heavy ball is in the group you didn't weigh.

            \item 
              Select two balls from the group containing the heavy ball and put them on the balance.
              If one of them is heavier, it, obviously, is the heavy ball.  Otherwise, the third ball
              is the heavy ball. 

          \end{itemize}

          This procedure works for any number of balls that is a power of three. The number of
          weighings required is equal to the exponent:

          \begin{tabular}{rrr}
            \toprule
            Exponent & Number of Balls & Number of Weighings \\
            \midrule
            0        & $3^0 = 1$       & 0 \\
            1        & $3^1 = 3$       & 1 \\
            2        & $3^2 = 9$       & 2 \\
            3        & $3^3 = 27$      & 3 \\
            4        & $3^4 = 81$      & 4 \\
            \vdots   & \vdots          & \vdots \\
            \bottomrule
          \end{tabular}

        \end{solution}

      \question

        You throw away your balance and buy a scale instead.  But you are now faced with a different
        problem.  

        You have 10 stacks of coins, each of which contains 10 coins.  You know that one stack is full
        of counterfeit coins while all the other stacks contain real coins.  You also know that a real
        coin weighs 10 ounces while a counterfeit coin weighs 11 ounces.  What is the smallest number
        of weighings required to identify the stack of counterfeit coins?

        \begin{solution}

          The best approach only requires one weighing.  The key is to notice that you can select
          different numbers of coins from each stack.  So what you do is select 1 coin from the first
          stack, 2 coins from the second stack, 3 coins from the third stack, etc. and weigh them all at
          once.

          If all of the coins were real coins, you would expect the total to be: 
          \[ 
            10 \del{ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 }  = 10 \cdot 55 = 550 
          \]

          The actual total will be more than the expected total by the stack number.  

          For example, suppose stack 7 contains the counterfeit coins.  The seven coins you included from
          stack 7 all weigh one ounce more than they should, so the total in this case will be: 
          \[ 
            550 + 7 = 662 
          \]

          To get the number of the stack containing the counterfeit coins, you just need to subtract 550
          from whatever it says on the scale.

        \end{solution}

  \end{questions}

        going to take it because it really belongs to me and it would be better for everyone if I
        had it. It's true of children fighting over toys. And it's true of governments going to war.
