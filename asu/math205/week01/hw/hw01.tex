        The data show the percentage of each age group that bought music.  A
        pie chart might show what percentage of the total online music market
        went to each age group, which is a completely different set of numbers.

              \item The center is around 2 servings---about half the girls eat 2
                or fewer servings and about half the girls eat more than two
                servings.

              \item The data is right-skewed.  
            
              \item The spread is from 0 servings to 8 servings.
            \end{itemize*}

        \begin{enumerate}[{a}]
          \item The shape is symmetric with a center around 110.  Ignoring the

          \item 62 out of 78 or 79\% of the students had scores over 100.
        \end{enumerate}

      \item[32]
        \begin{enumerate}[{a}]
          \item Ignoring the outliers, the shape looks symmetric.

          \item The center seems to be around 2\%.

          \item The smallest return was around -12\% and the largest return was
          around 12\%.

          \item About a third, or 33\% of the months had a return less than
          zero.

          \item[c] Graph b and graph c both have two choices.  The number of
            females/males is probably more even than the number of left
            handed/right handed, so graph c is the female/male graph.

          \item[b] graph b

          \item[d] Graph d is evenly distributed around some average number, so
            this is probably the height.

          \item[a] Graph a shows a bunch of people who don't study at all, with
            gradually diminishing numbers of people who study more hours per
            night.

      \item[34]

          \item The distribution is right-skewed.  Most of the oils have a low
            ratio but there are a few outliers on the high end.

          \item All the fish oils have ratios greater than or equal to 2 which
          makes them pretty healthy.

      \item[35]
        \begin{enumerate}[{a}]
          \item Since the states have varying numbers of people, it's more
          interesting to know the ratio of doctors to people than the total
          number of doctors.

          \item 
            \begin{figure}[H]

            \end{figure}

            The histogram is right-skewed with a center around 230.  Washington
            DC is an outlier, probably because it is a city and not a state.

        \end{enumerate}

      % this problem asks you to do a split stem plot which doesn't make sense

      %   The histogram is right-skewed with a center around 1000. and a spread of
      %   3000, ignoring the one outlier.  1987 was an outlier.

      \item[40]
        \begin{enumerate}[{a}]
          \item You would expect the categories with the most drivers to have
          the most accidents, regardless of any effect pot might have.  

          To find the accident rate per driver, divide the number of accidents in each
          category by the number of drivers in each category.

          \begin{table}[H]
            \centering
            \begin{tabular}{lrrr}
              \toprule
              Usage        & Drivers & Accidents & Rate \\
              \midrule
              Never        & 452.00  & 59.00     & 0.13 \\
              1--10 Times  & 229.00  & 36.00     & 0.16 \\
              11--50 Times & 70.00   & 15.00     & 0.21 \\
              51+ Times    & 156.00  & 50.00     & 0.32 \\
              \bottomrule
            \end{tabular}
          \end{table}

          It isn't part of the question, but it's also interesting that the 11--50
          category has so few drivers.  Probably there are quite a few people who never
          smoke pot, quite a few who smoke occasionally at parties, and then a decent
          number of regular pot smokers.  There aren't many in the intermediate 11--50
          category.

          \item 
            \begin{figure}[H]
              \centering

              \caption{Exercise 40}
            \end{figure}

            The pot smokers tend to get in more car accidents.

        \end{enumerate}

      \item[41]
        Most coins you would find would probably have been made in the last
        decade.  However, coins have a long life, so you might find a few coins
        which are 40 or 50 years old.

      \item[44]
        \begin{enumerate}[{a}]
          \item In each year, the prices are highest around July and lowest around January.  
          
            \item There is a long term year over year increase in the prices.

            \item Prices plummeted in 2007

        \end{enumerate}

      \item[45]
        \begin{enumerate}[{a}]
          \item
            The center is around 13.  About half the years had less than 13
            attacks and about half the years had 13 or more attacks.  

            \begin{figure}[H]

            \end{figure}

            16 of the 21 years between 1986 and 2007 had more than 13 attacks per year.
