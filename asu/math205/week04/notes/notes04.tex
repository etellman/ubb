  \section{Scatter Plots}

  \subsection{Notes}
  \begin{itemize*}
    \item show relationship between two quantitative variables
    \item each data point is an observation
    \item if one thing may be causing the other, put cause on x-axis and
      result on y-axis
    \item units can be different
    \item when variables are correlated, the points in a scatter plot tend to
      gather around the SD line.  The SD line 
      \begin{itemize*}
        \item goes through $(\bar{x}, \bar{y})$
        \item has slope $\pm \frac{s_y}{s_x}$
      \end{itemize*}

    \item If you plot z-scores instead of raw numbers, when the variables are
      correlated, the points tend to gather around a line that goes through the
      origin with a slope of one.

  \end{itemize*}

  \subsection{Correlation Doesn't Imply Causation}  

  \subsubsection{Cancer} % (fold)
  
  The relationship may be coincidental.  For example, from 1980--1995
  incarceration rates and CD sales both increased dramatically.  The
  relationship is probably coincidental.  

  To prove that smoking causes disease, you have to eliminate potential
  confounding factors like:
  \begin{itemize*}
    \item smokers tend to live in cities and are exposed to more pollution
    \item smokers are more often men, and men are more prone to heart disease
    \item long-time smokers tend to be older, and older people tend to get
      cancer
    \item is there some gene that both causes cancer and causes people to
      want to smoke?
  \end{itemize*}

  The relationship may be due to a ``confounding factor.''  
  
  For example, UBB has a strong negative correlation with recidivism, but some
  part of the explanation is that UBB attracts students who are unlikely
  recidivism candidates anyway.   The confounding factor is that UBB may just be
  identifying prisoners who are already low-recidivism risks, rather than
  reducing the recidivism risk for high-risk prisoners.

  \subsubsection{Amazon CPU vs.\ Error Rate} % (fold)

  Error rate and CPU usage were correlated. The team theorized that the high
  CPU usage was causing the errors. Actually it was the other way around.
  Choosing the correct variable for each axis is important, since whatever is on
  the x-axis is viewed as the cause.
  

  \section{Correlation Coefficient}
  \[
    r = \frac{1}{n - 1} \sum z_x z_y
  \]

  \begin{itemize*}
    \item numerical measure of strength of relationship between two quantitative
      variables

    \item draw picture of quadrants, +/+ in Q1 and -/- in Q2

    \item sum of products of z-scores

    \item $-1 \leq r \leq 1$

    \item 1 means exact positive correlation, -1 means exact negative
      correlation

    \item if the correlation is high (absolute value), knowing the value of
      one variable allows you to accurately guess the value of the
      other one

    \item correlation doesn't mean causation.  

    \item adding constant to every term just shifts line up, doesn't change
      correlation

  \end{itemize*}

  if x and y match exactly:
  \begin{align*}
    r & = \frac{1}{n - 1} \sum z_x z_x \\
      & = \frac{1}{n - 1} \sum \frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{s_x} \cdot \frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{s_x} \\
      & = \frac{1}{n - 1} \sum \frac{\del{ x_i - \bar{x} }^2}{s_x^2} \\
      & = \frac{1}{n - 1} \sum \frac{(n - 1) s_x^2}{s_x^2} \\
      & = \frac{n - 1}{n - 1} \\
      & = 1 \\
  \end{align*}

    \item If men always married women 8 inches shorter, what would the
      correlation between their heights be?
      
      \begin{solution}
        \[
          h_w = h_m - 8
        \]

        You can exactly predict the woman's height if you know the man's
        height, so the correlation is 1.

      \end{solution}

    \item If men always married women 8\% shorter, what would the correlation
      between their heights be?
      \begin{solution}
        \[
          h_w = 0.92 h_m 
        \]

        You can exactly predict the woman's height if you know the man's
        height, so the correlation is 1.

      \end{solution}

    \item Match correlations with data:

      data:
      \begin{itemize*}
        \item GPA for freshman year and sophomore year
        \item GPA for freshman year and senior year
        \item length and weight of 2x4s
      \end{itemize*}

      \begin{itemize*}
        \item 0.95
        \item 0.60

  \section{Crime and Incarceration Rates}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item According to Figure~\ref{fig:before_1991}, incarceration rates need to
      go up to keep up with the rising crime rate.

    \item According to Figure~\ref{fig:after_1991}, increasing incarceration rates 
      reduce the crime rate.

    \item According to Figure~\ref{fig:all_years} the optimum incarceration rate
      which minimizes the crime rate is either around 400 or 1000. 
      
  \end{itemize}

  In reality, there is no clear correlation between the incarceration rate and
  the crime rate and the crime rate.

  Figure~\ref{fig:rates_over_time} shows the crime rate went up and then down
  between 1980 and 2010. The incarceration rate went up because of ``three
  strikes'' laws passed in the 1980's and then naturally stabilized at the new
  high rate after 20 years, probably because the new sentences average around 20
  years.
