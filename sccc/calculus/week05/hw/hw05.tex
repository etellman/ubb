      \item[1] $\lim_{x \to 4} f(x) = f(4)$

      \item[3] 
        \begin{itemize}
          \item $-4$ because $f(-4)$ is not defined

          \item $-2$, $2$ and $4$ because the limit is not defined or is different
            depending on the direction

          \item $-2$ is continuous from the left and $2$ and $4$ are continuous from the
            right.

        \end{itemize}

      \item[4] $f$ is continuous on $[-4, -2)$, $(-2, 2)$, $[2, 4)$, $(4, 6)$ 
          and $(6, 8)$.

      \item[5] graph

      \item[6] graph

      \item[9] Since $f$ is continuous and $f(3) = 5$, $\lim_{x \to 3} f(x) = 5$.

        \begin{align*}
          \lim_{x \to 3} \left[ 2 f(x) - g(x) \right] & = 4 \\
          10 - \lim_{x \to 3} g(x)                    & = 4 \\
          \lim_{x \to 3} g(x)                         & = 6 \\
        \end{align*}

      \item[16] 
        \[
          \lim_{x \to -1^-} f(x) \neq \lim_{x \to -1^+} f(x) \neq f(x)
        \]

      \item[17] 
        \[
          \lim_{x \to 0^-} f(x) \neq \lim_{x \to 0^+} f(x) 
        \]

      \item[21] This is a rational function, so by Theorem 5 it is continuous everywhere
        in its domain.

      \item[22] 
        
        $\sqrt[3]{x}$ is a root function so it is continuous everywhere in its
        domain by Theorem 7.

        $1 + x^3$ is a polynomial so it is continuous everywhere by Theorem 5.

        $G(x)$ is a product of two continuous functions, so it is continuous
        everywhere in its domain by Theorem 4.

      \item[25] 
        
        $e^{-5t}$ is an exponential function so it is continuous everywhere 
        by Theorem 7.

        $\cos 2 \pi t$ is a trigonometric function so it is continuous
        everywhere by Theorem 7.

        $L(x)$ is a product of two continuous functions, so it is continuous
        everywhere in its domain by Theorem 4.

      \item[35] $x^2$ and $\sqrt{x}$ are continuous everywhere in their domains
        by Theorem 7.

        The only possible discontinuity would be at $x = 1$.
        \begin{align*}
          \lim_{x \to 1^-} f(x) & = \lim_{x \to 1^-} x^2 = 1 \\
          \lim_{x \to 1^+} f(x) & = \lim_{x \to 1^+} \sqrt{x} = 1 \\
          f(1)                  & = \sqrt{1} = 1 \\
        \end{align*}

        because:
        \[
          \lim_{x \to 1^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to 1^+} f(x) = f(1) 
        \]

        $f$ is continuous at $x = 1$ and $f$ is continuous on $(-\infty, \infty)$

      \item[37] The only possible discontinuities are at $x = 0$ and $x = 2$.

        \begin{figure}[H]

          \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{ex37.pdf}
          \caption{Exercise 37}
          \label{fig:ex37}
        \end{figure}

        \begin{align*}
          \lim_{x \to 0^-} f(x) & = 1 \\
          \lim_{x \to 0^+} f(x) & = 2 \\
          \\
          \lim_{x \to 2^-} f(x) & = 0 \\
          \lim_{x \to 2^+} f(x) & = 0 \\
          f(2)                  & = 0 \\
        \end{align*}

        $f$ is discontinuous at $x = 0$ and continuous everywhere else.

        See Figure \ref{fig:ex37}.

      \item[40]
        The only possible discontinuity is at the surface of the earth where $r = R$. For this point:
        \begin{align*}
          \lim_{r \to R^-} F(r) & = \frac{GMR}{R^3} = \frac{GM}{R^2} \\
          \lim_{r \to R^+} F(r) & = \frac{GM}{R^2} \\
          F(R)                  & = \frac{GM}{R^2} \\
        \end{align*}

        Since
        \[
          \lim_{r \to R^-} F(r) = \lim_{r \to R^+} F(r) = F(R)
        \]

        $F$ is continuous everywhere on its domain. For this function, non-positive
        numbers don't make sense, so the domain is $(0, \infty)$.

      \item[41]
        We need to find a value of $c$ where the two pieces of the function will have the
        same value for $x = 2$:

        \begin{align*}
          2^2 c + 2 \cdot 2 & = 2^3 - 2c \\
          c                 & = \frac{2}{3} \\
        \end{align*}

        This value makes the function:
        \[
          f(x) = 
            \begin{cases}
              \frac{2}{3} x^2 + 2x & \text{if } x < 2 \\
              x^3 - \frac{2}{3} x  & \text{if } x \geq 2 \\
            \end{cases}
        \]

        $\lim_{x \to 2} f(x) = f(2) = \frac{20}{3}$

      % \item[43]
      %   \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
      %     \item 
      %       \begin{align*}
      %         \frac{x^4 - 1}{x - 1} & = (x + 1)(x^2 + 1) \\
      %         \lim_{x \to 1} f(x)   & = 4 \\
      %       \end{align*}
      %   \end{enumerate}

      %   \[
      %     g(x) = 
      %       \begin{cases}
      %         f(x) & \text{if } x \neq 1 \\
      %         4    & \text{if } x = 1 \\
      %       \end{cases}
      %   \]

      \item[45]
        \begin{align*}
          f(0) &= 0 \\
          f(100) &= 10,000 + 10 \sin 100 > 1000
        \end{align*}

        By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there has to be some value of $x$ between
        $0$ and $100$ where $f(x) = 1000$.

      \item[61]
        Let $f(x)$ be the difference between the number and its cube:
        \[
          f(x) = x - x^3  \\
        \]

        Since:
        \begin{align*}
          f(-2) &= 6 \\
          f(-1) &= 0 \\
        \end{align*}

        By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there is some value of $x$ between $x = -1$ and
        $x = -2$ where $f(x) = 1$

        According to my computer, a value of $x \approx -1.32472$ is about right.

      \item[63]
        By Theorem 9, $f(x)$ is continuous everywhere except possibly $x = 0$, since it is
        a composition of two functions which are continuous everywhere except $x = 0$.

        We can use the Squeeze Theorem to determine if $f(x)$ is also continuous at
        $x = 0$.

        \[
          -x^4 \leq x^4 \sin \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \leq x^4
        \]

        \begin{align*}
          \lim_{x \to 0} -x^4 = \lim_{x \to 0} x^4 = 0
        \end{align*}

        By the Squeeze Theorem: $\lim_{x \to 0} x^4 \sin \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = 0$

        Since $\lim_{x \to 0} f(x) = f(0)$, $f$ is continuous at $x = 0$.

      % \item[65]
      %   Picture two makes making the trip on the same day, where they both start at 7:00
      %   AM and one monk starts from the top of the mountain and the other monk starts from
      %   the bottom of the mountain at the same time. The monks will pass each other on the
      %   path some time during the day, regardless of how fast they walk.
