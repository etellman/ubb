      \item[34] 
        \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
          \item 
            \[
              137 \pm 2.576 \cdot \frac{65}{\sqrt{269}} \approx 137 \pm 10.2
            \]
            The 99\% confidence interval is from \fbox{126.8 to 147.2}.

          \item The students selected must be a simple random sample.

        \end{enumerate}

      \item[36] 
        \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
          \item 
            \[
              248 \pm 2.576 \cdot \frac{65}{\sqrt{269}} \approx 248 \pm 10.2
            \]
            The 99\% confidence interval is from \fbox{237.8 to 258.2}.

          \item The students selected must be a simple random sample.

        \end{enumerate}

      \item[37] This is incorrect. The correct statement is that we can be 95\%
        confident that the actual mean BMI is somewhere between 26.2 and 27.4.

        If we did 20 similar surveys, 19 of them would have a mean BMI in this
        range.

      \item[38] This is also incorrect. See Exercise 37.

      \item[40]
        \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
          \item The null hypothesis is that students study 120 minutes or less
            per night. The alternative hypothesis is that students study more
            than 120 minutes per night.

          \item
            \begin{align*}
              \sigma_{\bar{x}} & = \frac{64}{\sqrt{269}} = 5 \\
              z                & = \frac{137 - 120}{5} \approx 3.4
            \end{align*}

          \item The p-value is 
            \[
              p \approx 1 - 0.9997 = \boxed{ 0.0003 } 
            \]
            There is 0.03\% chance of observing a survey result of 137 if
            students actually study 120 minutes or less per night, so we can
            conclude they study more than 120 minutes per night.

        \end{enumerate}

      \item[42]
        \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
          \item The null hypothesis is that hotel managers have a mean
            femininity score of 5.29. The alternative hypothesis is that hotel
            managers have a mean femininity score different from 5.29.

          \item
            \begin{align*}
              \sigma_{\bar{x}} & = \frac{0.78}{\sqrt{128}} \\
                               & \approx 0.06411 \\
              \\
              z & = \frac{5.29 - 5.19}{0.06411} \\
                & \approx \boxed{ 1.560 } \\
            \end{align*}

          \item The p-value is 
            \begin{align*}
              P(z \geq 1.560) & = P(z \leq -1.560) \\
                              & \approx 0.0594 \\
              \\
              p & \approx 2 \cdot 0.0594 \\
                & \approx \boxed{ 0.1188 }
            \end{align*}

            There is 12\% chance of observing a result this far from the mean by
            chance, so the survey isn't good evidence that hotel managers are
            different.

        \end{enumerate}

      \item[43] The real explanation is that there is only a 0.03 probability of
        the observed result if the null hypothesis is true. 
        
        The p-value is a statement about the likelihood of the observed result,
        not the likelihood of the null hypothesis. If the observed result is
        very unlikely if the null hypothesis is true, you can reasonably
        conclude that the null hypothesis probably isn't true.

      \item[44] If there was no difference between the pig owners and the
        non-pig owners, there is only 0.01 probability of observing the
        differences in numbers of pigs in the graves between the rich and poor
        people.

      \item[45] There is only a 3.1\% chance of observing this much nitrogen if
        the cicadas had no effect on the plants.

      \item[46] There is a 0.62 probability of a woody plant quantity this far
        from the mean, even if the tree destruction had no effect.

        There is a 0.98 probability of a stem density this far from the mean, even
        if the tree destruction had no effect.

        Either of the differences is easily be explained by natural variation.

      \item[48] 
        \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
          \item If she already knows the sample mean is greater than the
            population mean, then the chance of the sample mean being unusually
            greater than the population mean is greater than the chance of the
            sample mean being unusually different (not just greater) from the
            population mean.

          \item The correct P-value is $2 \cdot 0.0179 = 0.0357$. There is a
            3.5\% chance of observing a value this far from the mean.

        \end{enumerate}

      \item[49] P-values are always less than 1. The correct value is 0.0918.

      \item[50]
        \begin{figure}[H]

          \includegraphics{ex50.pdf}
          \caption{Exercise 50}
          \label{fig:ex50}
        \end{figure}

        \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
          \item See Figure \ref{fig:ex50}. The data actually looks left-skewed
            and not particularly normal.

          \item
            \begin{align*}
              \bar{x}          & = 30,841 \\
              \sigma_{\bar{x}} & = \frac{3000}{\sqrt{20}} \approx 670.82 \\
              \\
              z_{0.95} & = 1.6445 \\
              z_{0.05} & = -1.6445 \\
              \\
              \mu & = 30,841 \pm 1.6445 \cdot 670.82 \\
                  & = \boxed{ \unit[30,841 \pm 1103]{lb} } \\
            \end{align*}
        \end{enumerate}

      \item[51]
        \begin{figure}[H]
          \centering
          \includegraphics{ex51.pdf}
          \caption{Exercise 51}
          \label{fig:ex51}
        \end{figure}

        \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
          \item See Figure \ref{fig:ex51}. 

          \item
            \begin{align*}
              \bar{x}          & = -3.587 \\
              \sigma_{\bar{x}} & = \frac{2.5}{\sqrt{47}} \approx 0.3647 \\
              \\
              z_{0.995} & = 2.5758 \\
              \\
              \mu & = -3.587 \pm 2.5758 \cdot 0.3657 \\
                  & = -3.587 \pm 0.9393 \\
            \end{align*}

            We can be 99\% confident that the average bone loss for the
            population is between $-4.5265$ and $-2.6479$.

        \end{enumerate}

      \item[52]
        \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
          From exercise 50:
          \begin{align*}
            \bar{x}          & = 30,841 \\
            \sigma_{\bar{x}} & \approx 670.82 \\
          \end{align*}

          \item 
            The null hypothesis is that the mean value is 32,000 lbs.
            \begin{align*}
              \bar{x} - \mu_0 & = 30,841 - 32,000 \\
                              & = -1159 \\
              z & = \frac{-1159}{670.82} \\
                & \approx -1.7277 \\
            \end{align*}

            From Table A, if the actual mean is 32,000 lbs, there is a 0.042
            probability of observing a value as small as 30,841 lbs or as large
            as 33,159 (same distance in the other direction).

            The P-value is 0.084 so we can reject the null hypothesis at a
            significance level of 0.10. There is less than a 10\% chance of
            getting a value at least 1159 lbs from 32,000 lbs.

          \item 
            The null hypothesis is that the mean value is 31,500 lbs.
            \begin{align*}
              \bar{x} - \mu_0 & = 30,841 - 31,500 \\
                              & = -659 \\
              \\
              z  & = \frac{-659}{670.82} \\
                 & \approx -0.9824 \\
            \end{align*}

            From Table A, if the actual mean is 31,500 lbs, there is a 0.1630
            probability of observing a value of 30,841 or less.

            The two-sided P-value is 0.32 so we can't reject this null hypothesis
            at a significance level of 0.10. If the actual mean is 31,500 lbs,
            there is a 32\% chance of getting a value at least 659 lbs away from
            31,500 lbs with this sample size.

        \end{enumerate}

      \item[53]
        From exercise 51:
        \begin{align*}
            \bar{x}          & = -3.587 \\
            \sigma_{\bar{x}} & \approx 0.3647 \\
        \end{align*}

        The null hypothesis is that there is no change in bone density and
        $\mu_0 = 0$.

        \begin{align*}
          \bar{x} - \mu_0 & = -3.587 - 0 \\
                          & = -3.587 \\
          z & = \frac{-3.587}{0.3647} \\
            & \approx -9.8364 \\
        \end{align*}

        There is essentially zero chance of getting this result by chance,
        so we can confidently reject the null hypothesis and conclude that
        the moms are losing bone density.

      \item[55]
        \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
          \item The null hypothesis is that the eye grease does nothing and the
            average difference is zero. The alternative hypothesis is that the
            eye grease increases sensitivity and the difference is positive.

          \item
            \begin{align*}
              \sigma  & = 0.22 \\
              \bar{x} & = 0.10125 \\
              \mu_0   & = 0 \\
              \\
              \bar{x} - \mu_0  & = 0.10125 \\
              \sigma_{\bar{x}} & = \frac{0.10125}{\sqrt{16}} \\
                               & = 0.055 \\
              \\
              z & = \frac{0.10125}{0.055} \\
                & \approx 1.8409 \\
            \end{align*}

            From Table A, there is a 0.0328 probability of a value at least this
            high so we can reject the null hypothesis with a P-value of 0.0328.

        \end{enumerate}

      \item[57]
        \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
          \item 
            \begin{align*}
              \bar{x} & = 126.07 \\
              n       & = 72 \\
              \sigma  & = 15 \\
              \\
              \sigma_{\bar{x}} & = \frac{15}{\sqrt{72}} \\
                               & \approx 1.7678 \\
                               \\
              z^* &= 1.2816 \\
              \delta &= 
            \end{align*}

            90\% confidence interval
