      \item read Chapter 4 
      \item take a look at the ``Check Your Skills'' exercises

    If you don't have a calculator with a correlation button or access to a computer
    that can do correlation, feel free to skip 29c and 32b.  
    
    Figuring out the correlation for a large data set is tedious without a computer.
    The other problems that ask for correlation only have a few points, so figuring
    it out by hand shouldn't be too bad.

        \begin{parts}
          \part yes
          \part One student got a 10 out of 100 on the test but estimated himself as
            a 4 out of 5 reader.  
        \end{parts}
    
      \item[26]
        \begin{figure}[H]

          \includegraphics{figures/ex26.eps}
          \caption{Exercise 26}
        \end{figure}

        The correlation is 0.5653 so it looks like there is a mild preference
        for tall people to date each other.

      \item[27]
        \begin{parts}
          \part
            \begin{figure}[H]
              \centering
              \includegraphics{figures/ex27.eps}

            \end{figure}

          \part
            The correlation is 0.9552.  There is a strong correlation between the
            coffee price and deforestation.

          \part
            The units of the price don't matter.  Changing the currency would just
            change the labels on the y axis.

        \end{parts}

      \item[28]
        \begin{figure}[H]
          \centering
          \includegraphics{figures/ex28.eps}
          \caption{Exercise 28}
        \end{figure}

        \begin{parts}
          \part
            The correlation is -0.7485.  There is a fairly strong negative correlation 
            between the number of birds that come back and the number of new birds.

            There probably isn't any room for new birds when large numbers of returning
            birds take up all the space.

          \part
            The sparrowhawk seems to be a long-lived territorial bird.

        \end{parts}

      \item[29]
        \begin{parts}
          \part
            \begin{figure}[H]
              \centering
              \includegraphics{figures/ex29.eps}
              \caption{Exercise 29}
            \end{figure}

          \part
            There is a strong positive correlation with one outlier at (155.2, 1.94).

          \part
            \begin{tabular}[H]{lr}
              \toprule
              with outlier    & 0.8486 \\
              without outlier & 0.7015 \\
              \bottomrule
            \end{tabular}

            The outlier has large positive z-scores for both neural activity and
            behavior, so it makes a large contribution to the total when computing
            the correlation.

        \end{parts}

      \item[31]
        \begin{figure}[H]
          \centering
          \includegraphics{figures/ex31.eps}
          \caption{Exercise 31}
        \end{figure}

        There is a strong correlation between time and icicle length.  Not
        surprisingly, if you pour water over an icicle, it gets longer over
        time.

        The more water you pour over the icicle, the slower it grows.  This is
        probably because the fast moving water doesn't have as much time to
        freeze.

      \item[32]
        \begin{parts}
          
          \part
            \begin{figure}[H]
              \centering
              \includegraphics{figures/ex32.eps}
              \caption{Exercise 32}
            \end{figure}

          \part The pattern is vaguely linear with a weak positive correlation of 0.1349.

          \part When you add the means, you can see that the best choice is 20 plants per
          acre.

        \end{parts}

      \item[34]
        \begin{parts}
          \part Changing the units would just change the labels on the y-axis.  It
          wouldn't change the correlation.  

          \part Subtracting 6 from all the men's heights doesn't change the correlation
          either.  This is just like changing the scale.

          The correlation just indicates that women tend to date men of similar
          heights.  It doesn't say anything about whether the women (tall or not)
          tend to date men that are taller than they are.

          \part In this case the correlation would be a perfect 1.
        \end{parts}

      \item[36] This might happen if the two funds both invest in companies in
        the same industry but one fund includes primarily large companies and
        the other fund includes primarily small companies.  
        
        The large company stocks are fairly stable so they don't tend to go up
        and down much.  The small company stocks tend to move up and down more.
        Both funds move the same direction because both small and large
        companies do well or badly for the same reasons.

        An investor which didn't want to take risks would invest in the fund
        which only moved 10\%.  He wouldn't make too much money but he also
        wouldn't lose too much money.  Another investor who didn't mind more
        risk might invest in the small company stocks.  He would have a chance
        to make more money, but that would come with a chance to lose more as well.

      \item[37]

          \part Rachel should invest in small-cap stocks.  When her bonds plummet in
          value, her small-cap stocks are likely to only drop slightly.

          \part She should look for a fund with a negative correlation.
        \end{parts}

      \item[38]
        The report doesn't say that good researchers make bad teachers.  It just says that
        you can't draw any conclusions about teaching ability from research ability and
        vice versa.  Some excellent researchers are also excellent teachers and some
        excellent researchers are horrible teachers.

      \item[39]
        \begin{parts}
          \part You can't have a correlation between a categorical variable and a
          quantitative variable.  You need two quantitative variables.

          \part Correlations are always less than or equal to 1.

          \part Correlations don't have units.
        \end{parts}

      \item[43]
        \begin{figure}[H]
          \centering
          \includegraphics{figures/ex43.eps}
          \caption{Exercise 43}

        It looks like people tend to use about the same gas (not much) in the warm months,
        with or without solar panels.  People with solar panels tend to use less gas than
        people without in the cold months.

        In either case there is a strong positive correlation between cold months (high
        degree days) and gas usage.

      \item[44]
        \begin{figure}[H]
          \centering

        The more breeding pairs there are, the fewer pairs return each year.
