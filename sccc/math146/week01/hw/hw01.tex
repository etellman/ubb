        went to each age group, which is a completely different set of numbers.

          \item[c] Graph b and graph c both have two choices.  The number of
            females/males is probably more even than the number of left
            handed/right handed, so graph c is the female/male graph.

          \item[b] graph b

          \item[d] Graph d is evenly distributed around some average number, so
            this is probably the height.

          \item[a] Graph a shows a bunch of people who don't study at all, with
            gradually diminishing numbers of people who study more hours per
            night.

          \part The distribution is right-skewed.  Most of the oils have a low
            ratio but there are a few outliers on the high end.

          \part All the fish oils have ratios greater than or equal to 2 which
          makes them pretty healthy.

          \part Since the states have varying numbers of people, it's more
          interesting to know the ratio of doctors to people than the total
          number of doctors.

            \end{figure}

            The histogram is right-skewed with a center around 230.  Washington
            DC is an outlier, probably because it is a city and not a state.

      % this problem asks you to do a split stem plot which doesn't make sense

      %   The histogram is right-skewed with a center around 1000. and a spread of
      %   3000, ignoring the one outlier.  1987 was an outlier.

        The fish recruitment increased until 1989 and then declined.

      \item[40]
        \begin{parts}
          \part You would expect the categories with the most drivers to have
          the most accidents, regardless of any effect pot might have.  

          To find the accident rate per driver, divide the number of accidents in each
          category by the number of drivers in each category.

          \begin{table}[H]
            \centering
            \begin{tabular}{lrrr}
              \toprule
              Usage       & Drivers & Accidents & Rate \\
              \midrule
              Never       & 452.00  & 59.00     & 0.13 \\
              1-10 Times  & 229.00  & 36.00     & 0.16 \\
              11-50 Times & 70.00   & 15.00     & 0.21 \\
              51+ Times   & 156.00  & 50.00     & 0.32 \\
              \bottomrule
            \end{tabular}
          \end{table}

          It isn't part of the question, but it's also interesting that the 11-50
          category has so few drivers.  Probably there are quite a few people who never
          smoke pot, quite a few who smoke occasionally at parties, and then a decent
          number of regular pot smokers.  There aren't many in the intermediate 11-50
          category.

            \begin{figure}[H]

              \caption{Exercise 40}
            \end{figure}

            It looks like the pot smokers tend to get in more car accidents.

      \item[41]
        Most coins you would find would probably have been made in the last
        decade.  However, coins have a long life, so you might find a few coins
        which are 40 or 50 years old.

      \item[44]

          \part In each year, the prices are highest around July and lowest around January.  
          
            \part There is a long term year over year increase in the prices.

            \part Prices plummeted in 2007

            The center is around 13.  About half the years had less than 13
            attacks and about half the years had 13 or more attacks.

            \end{figure}

            16 of the 21 years between 1986 and 2007 had more than 13 attacks per year.

        ``We Shall Overcome,'' the government has failed us. This is part of
        what's wrong with you---you do too much singing.  Today it's time to
        stop singing and start swinging.
