    \section{Calculations}

    Some of the problems are very tedious to do without a calculator or
    computer that can compute correlation and regression lines.  To make things
    easier, I did some of the calculations on my computer so you'll have the
    numbers even if you don't have a statistics calculator.

          nothing can live when the total organic carbon is close to zero, so

            \]

        People use artificial sweeteners because they are already overweight.

      \item[44]
        Some of the people that previously got B's are now getting A's since A's
        are easier to get.  The SAT hasn't changed, however, so this same group
        of people is still not doing as well on the SAT, bringing the overall
        average for the A group down.

        The same reasoning applies to the other grades.

      \item[45]
        As people get older, they tend to make more money up to the point when
        they retire.  Consequently, if there are more older but not retired
        people in the workforce, the mean income for the entire workforce goes
        up.

        This argument still applies, even if the median income for older people
        is decreasing over time, as long as it doesn't decrease so much that
        older people no longer make more than younger people.

        Since $r = 0.41$, every point above the mean on the midterm accounts for
        0.41 points above the mean on the final.  Since he scored 10 points

        Since $r^2 = 0.8391$, the stumps account for about 84\% of the variation
        in the larvae.  We can conclude that the beavers are helping the beetles
        by creating the stumps.

        The regression line for larvae based on stumps is:
        \[
          \hat{y} = -1.29 + 11.89 x 
        \]

        With all the data, $r^2 = 0.2798$.  The prediction accounts for about
        28\% of the variation.  
        
        If you throw out 2005, when he correctly predicted a very bad year,
        although the reality turned out to be even worse, $r^2 = 0.2260$ or only
        23\%.

        Including 2005, the regression equation is:
        \[
          \hat{y} = 0.9031 x + 1.8028
        \]

        For a year when he predicts 16 hurricanes, you should actually expect
        around 16.25 hurricanes.
